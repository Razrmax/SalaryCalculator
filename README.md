The Salary Calculator project is intended at calculating the net salary.
The program calculates tax based on national rates, as well as all deductibles and credits associated with salary, and then displays the resulting net payment.
The first iteration of the program is developed with the Netherlands taxes, credits and deductibles.
Other locales are to be added in the later development stages.
This is not a commercial but rather an educational portfolio application, and in that should be treated as such.
The calculating algorithms are based on the information available online at https://www.belastingdienst.nl/, as well as some accounting forums, and may contain errors and/or uncertainties.
